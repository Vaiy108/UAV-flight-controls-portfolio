# UAV Flight Controls Portfolio (C++ + Crazyflie)

This repository is a curated portfolio demonstrating:
- **PID-based flight control** implementation in **C++** (Udacity FCND Controls project)
- **Real UAV hardware integration** using **Crazyflie 2.0 + Crazyradio** (Python scripts, telemetry, maneuvers)

## Repository Structure
- `cpp-controls/` — C++ control project (simulation/controller implementation)
- `crazyflie-python/` — Crazyflie 2.0 hardware work (scripts + logs)
- `docs/` — short technical notes, results, and setup

## Quick Status
- FCND-Controls-CPP: completed locally ✅ (will be added/linked)
- Crazyflie 2.0: assembled + connected via Crazyradio; basic maneuvers completed ✅ (scripts/logs to be added)

## Tech Stack
C++, CMake, Python, Crazyflie, Crazyradio
